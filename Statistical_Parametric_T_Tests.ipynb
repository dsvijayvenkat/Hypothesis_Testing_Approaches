    "### Problem Statement: Analyzing Factors Influencing Subscription to a Term Deposit\n",
    "\n",
    "A bank has collected data on various attributes of its clients and their interactions with the bank's marketing campaigns. The bank is interested in understanding the factors that influence whether a client subscribes to a term deposit or not. The bank wants to perform statistical tests to analyze these factors and gain insights into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to identify significant differences and relationships between various attributes and the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit. This can provide insights into which attributes play a key role in influencing the clients' decision to subscribe, helping the bank tailor its marketing strategies and improve its campaign success rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this objective, we will perform three different types of t-tests on the provided dataset: one-sample t-test, two-sample t-test, and paired sample t-test. Each test will target specific attributes and relationships to determine their statistical significance with respect to the subscription outcome. By conducting these tests, we can uncover patterns, trends, and key factors that impact the clients' decisions regarding term deposit subscriptions.\n",
