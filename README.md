Introduction to Hypothesis testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical technique used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. In this method, we start with a null hypothesis that assumes no difference or relationship between two or more variables, and an alternative hypothesis that asserts a difference or relationship.

We then collect sample data and use statistical tests to determine whether the data supports the null hypothesis or not. The results of the test allow us to either accept or reject the null hypothesis and draw conclusions about the population parameter of interest.

The hypothesis testing process involves several steps, including:

    Formulating the null and alternative hypotheses based on the research question and available information.
    Selecting an appropriate statistical test based on the research question, sample size, and type of data.
    Determining the level of significance or alpha value to use, which represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
    Collecting sample data and calculating the test statistic, which measures the difference between the sample data and the null hypothesis.
    Using the test statistic and the critical values from the statistical table or software to determine whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis.
    Interpreting the results and drawing conclusions about the population parameter of interest based on the decision to reject or accept the null hypothesis.

Hypothesis testing is widely used in various fields such as psychology, medicine, engineering, business, and more to make informed decisions and draw reliable conclusions based on sample data.
